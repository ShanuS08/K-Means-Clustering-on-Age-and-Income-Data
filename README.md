# K-Means-Clustering-on-Age-and-Income-Data
This project applies K-Means clustering to categorize individuals based on their age and income levels. The data is normalized using MinMaxScaler, and the clustering results are visualized to highlight the distinct clusters and their centroids.

# Features
- Normalized the Age and Income columns using MinMaxScaler.
- Applied K-Means clustering to identify 3 clusters.
- Calculated cluster centers and classified individuals into clusters.
- Plotted data points with different colors representing each cluster.
- Highlighted cluster centroids with a distinct marker.

# Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries:pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn
